  <h1><i>About<i></h1>
  <p>We are 4 students at Girls Who Code in New York City. For our final project, we decided to make a website targeting kids struggling with
      their sexuality and/or gender identity. We chose this topic because we all know people who are struggling and need resources.
      This site is targeted at children and teens who are struggling with their identity and parents who want to suport their kids
      but are unsure of how to.</p>
