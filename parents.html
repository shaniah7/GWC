  <p> Having your kid come out to you can be emotional, sad, suprising, but it does not have to be difficult.</p>
</div>

<div id="ifwe">
    <p> Here are some tips for when your child comes out to you: </p>
    <p> 1: Don't push.
      Your child will tell you what they want to tell you when they are ready.
      It may take time, but your child will eventually tell you everything.
      In the meantime, don't pry and be patient with them. </p>
    <p> 2: Be supportive. Your child is oviously coming to you beause they love and trust you. Whatever they choose to tell you
        should be met with understanding.Maybe tell them you love them and that nothing will change. </p>
    <p> 3: Research. After your child comes out, educate yourself. Learn about the LGBTQ+ community. Also try to learn terms
          that are offensive and not offensive. Althoug your words may be well-intentioned, using the wrong language can cause your child to close theselves off.</p>
    <p> 4: Respect your child. After your child comes out, ask them a few relevant questions. Ask them what pronouns they would like to use, and use them.
      Ask them if they wuld like to use a different name, and use it as well. Next, ask your child if you can tell people about their orientation/identity.
      If the answer is no, respect their wishes. Outing is never okay. Finally, ask them if you can do anything to help them. They may want to dress in a new way, cut their hair,
      or change their room. Respect their choices, and try to help them in any way possible. </p>
    <p>5: Be patient. For LGBTQ+ children, he teenage years can be a difficult time. When your child comes out, they may not have everything figured out and that's okay.
      Your child does not need to have everything figured out, and you shouldn't push them to. Be patient. Your child will figure it out in time. They need you
      to be there for them.</p>
      <p> 6: Don't belittle your child: "Kids are a lot smarter than most adults give them credit for. Your child may not know the actual terms for things but they do know how they feel.
         Instead of trying to convince them to 'wait,' or telling them theyâ€™re 'too young,' let them figure it out for themselves. But still offer your support along the way.
          Trying to discourage them simply due to their age can confuse them and even cause depression and/or anxiety." </p>
        <p> 7: Let your child live: Don't tell your cild how open or private they should be about their orientation or gender identity. It's not your choice.
          Your child's self-expression s their choice, and only theirs. Support their decision. How they choose to express themselves is part of who they are; don't shame or
          ridicule your child for being who they are.
          <p> Being a child in the LGBTQ+ community can be very difficult. Children are subject to bullying just because they are different.
            This can lead to depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. If you notice your child struggling, please seek help.
            There are some mental health resources specifically for LGBTQ+ children. We will link to a few of them below.</p>
